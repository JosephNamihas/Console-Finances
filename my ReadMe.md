# Console Finances

## Description
I was tasked by the client to analyse a set of figures to determine the following:

- The total months that the data spanned
- The net total amount of profit / losses over the given period
- The average change between each month
- The greatest increase in profits and it's associated month
- The greaest losses in profits and it's associated month

The data was provided in an multidimensional array

## Challenges Faced

### Currency

Dealing with currency faced a different challenge as I figured that rounding may cause issues with accuracy. I researched this a lot but any solouton seemed to be too complicated and nothing we had actually 'learnt' in class yet (classes etc). I opted to use toFixed, which rather than rounding, cuts the figure off at a certain decimal point

### Variable Names






### Messy but Functional

Like most of the code I'm writing at the moment, it seems to be messy, but scalable and most importantly functionable.
As I learn more algorithms and develop my problem solving, I'll become more efficent.


## For Next Time

Throughout the next few weeks and months, I'll be returning to this portfolio, cleaning it up and adding new elements / javaScript components. My new portfolio will be fine to build on. I hope to add a CV section in the 'Skills and CV' section. At the moment, my CV is not built up enough to advertise.

- Use a Modal to advertise my CV and then provide a link to download it.
- Add two more project panels to make the grid 3 x 2. 
- Continue to work on the responsivness.
